# Contributing Guidelines
First off, thank you for contributing your time, effort, and code to Ninetails! Your hard work is much appreciated. :smiley_cat: For the best experience possible, please try to follow the guidelines listed below. Following them will make things much smoother with less bugs.
> This document is a work in progress, so if you want to change or add something to it, by all means, start an issue!

## The three golden "rules"
### 1. Do not make your changes in the `main` branch; instead put your changes in the latest version branch.
This will make sure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes.

For example, say there are three branches: `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`. Even though, say, `v2` is the current released version, you would put your changes in the latest version branch, or `v3` in this case. If everyone does this, your PR should be up-to-date with the latest fixes and additions. If people start changing things in `main` the branches will diverge and it will be quite a headache for everyone, especially you as the maintainer of the PR.

### 2. Do everyone a favor and test before PRing.
Please make sure everything works **before** making a pull request. This will save time (and possibly a revert) in the future.

If you've already tested, give yourself a high five! :hand:

### 3. Try not to change the formatting of existing code.
This includes indentation and spacing. Use two spaces for tabs and try to double-space your functions.
