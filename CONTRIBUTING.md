## Contributing to Ninetails
We love it when people contribute to Ninetails, but to keep everything nice and neat, there are a few "rules".

**Try not to edit the formatting of existing code unless it's absolutely necessary.**

This means indentation, spacing, etc. Try to also follow the existing code format.

**Please compile Tailwind before making a pull request involving changes to the UI.**

You can do this by running `npm run tailwind` or `npm run dev`.

**Test your changes *completely* before making a pull request.**

Now others don't have to debug your code for you!

**Thank you for contributing! ðŸ˜¸**
